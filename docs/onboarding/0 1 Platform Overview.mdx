# Overview

thirdweb is a comprehensive development framework that empowers you to seamlessly
build, launch, and manage web3 applications and games across an extensive network
of 700+ blockchains.

# Architecture

Whether you're developing decentralized applications from scratch or enhancing existing ones, thirdweb's suite of tools accelerates your development workflow across the smart contract, application, and infrastructure layers.

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts serve as the foundational building blocks for any decentralized application. To ensure the highest level of quality and security, we conduct audits on our pre-built contracts. Our ContractKit extensions follow dynamic contract patterns by default. We also optimize contracts for gas efficiency, minimizing transaction costs. By prioritizing these technical considerations, we empower developers to focus on creating exceptional web3 applications with confidence and ease.

With [**ContractKit**](/contractkit), you can quickly build and customize smart contracts while enabling extensions that allow you to unlock more functionality. Whether you're launching your smart contract with the [**Deploy**](/deploy) tool or exploring pre-built contracts through [**Explore**](/explore), thirdweb streamlines the first steps of decentralized development. And with our intuitive [**Dashboard**](/dashboard), you can easily manage your smart contract and track its performance through **Data Feeds**.
