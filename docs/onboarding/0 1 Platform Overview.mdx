# Overview

thirdweb is a comprehensive development framework that empowers you to seamlessly
build, launch, and manage web3 applications and games across any EVM-compatible blockchain.

## Product Values

## Architecture

Whether you're developing decentralized applications from scratch or enhancing existing ones,
thirdweb's suite of tools accelerates your development workflow across the smart contract, application, and infrastructure layers.

### Smart Contracts

Smart contracts serve as the foundational building blocks for any decentralized application.
To ensure the highest level of quality and security, we conduct audits on our pre-built contracts.
Our ContractKit extensions follow dynamic contract patterns by default. We also optimize contracts for gas efficiency, minimizing transaction costs.
By prioritizing these technical considerations, we empower developers to focus on creating exceptional web3 applications with confidence and ease.

With [**ContractKit**](/contractkit), you can quickly build and customize smart contracts while enabling extensions that allow you to unlock more functionality.
Whether you're launching your smart contract with the [**Deploy**](/deploy) tool or exploring pre-built contracts through [**Explore**](/explore),
thirdweb streamlines the first steps of decentralized development.
Upon deployment, using thirdweb's [**Dashboard**](/dashboard), you can easily manage your smart contract and track its performance through **Data Feeds**.

:::info Import Contracts

thirdweb is designed to seamlessly integrate with any contract on any blockchain, regardless of whether it was deployed using thirdweb's tools.
Simply search for a contract's address on the dashboard and access all functionality from SDKs, analytics, an admin dashboard, RPCs, and much more.

### Applications

thirdweb offers software development kits (SDKs) that allow for seamless integration with your smart contract when developing applications or games using popular programming languages such as React, React Native, TypeScript, Python, Go, and Unity.

Our SDKs enable wallet connectivity and provide a robust set of functions for interacting with your smart contract, including built-in caching, remote procedure call (RPC) URLs, and an IPFS Gateway.
These features optimize performance and enhance the overall developer experience when building decentralized applications.

### Infrastructure

thirdweb offers a comprehensive suite of tools and technologies designed to facilitate the development of user-friendly and accessible decentralized applications. Our infrastructure includes options for fiat on-ramps, wallet integrations, and gasless relayers, providing seamless end-user experiences.

In addition, we provide storage solutions and remote procedure calls (RPCs) to optimize application performance and decentralization. Our indexer and Data Feeds enable easy integration of your contract's data into your application.

Lastly, thirdweb's Auth SDK is designed to support decentralized login and seamless integration with both client and server frameworks. This feature allows developers to build secure and user-friendly decentralized applications that can easily be deployed and integrated with other applications.

## Solutions

thirdweb is committed to providing complete toolkits for developers across various industries,
including gaming, e-commerce, finance, art, social media, and more. Our toolkits incorporate
a range of tools and technologies, both proprietary and in partnership with industry leaders.

thirdweb's [GamingKit](/gamingkit), developed in partnership with Coinbase, offers a streamlined approach to building blockchain-based games.
It includes pre-built contracts such as Marketplace, Multiwrap, Packs, Tokens, and more, as well as a [Unity SDK](/unity) to build your game.
GamingKit also enables easy fiat on-ramp solutions via Coinbase Pay.

Similarly, thirdweb’s [CommerceKit](/commercekit), developed in collaboration with Shopify, enables the creation of blockchain-based storefronts that can reward customers with digital assets.
The toolkit includes features for enabling token-gated commerce, loyalty programs, and easy configurations tools for digital collectible sales / royalty fees.

thirdweb's Minting solution enables creative minting mechanics and managing of digital assets created on both EVM Contracts as well as Solana’s programs.
It includes tools for signature-based minting, releasing collections of unique NFTs, wrapping tokens into newly wrapped NFT, randomized lootboxes, and more.
